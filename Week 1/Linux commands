## Creating Files and Assigning Permissions

### Creating a File

To create a file named `example.txt`, use the `touch` command:

```bash
touch example.txt
```

### Assigning Permissions

To assign read, write, and execute permissions to different user categories (owner, group, others), use the `chmod` command. Here are some examples:

- Assign read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, and read and execute permissions to the group and others:

```bash
chmod 755 example.txt
```

- Assign read and write permissions to the owner, and read permissions to the group and others:

```bash
chmod 644 example.txt
```

- Assign read, write, and execute permissions to the owner and the group, and no permissions to others:

```bash
chmod 770 example.txt
```

## Basic Linux Commands

### List Files and Directories

To list files and directories, use the `ls` command:

```bash
ls
```

To list all files, including hidden ones, use:

```bash
ls -a
```

### Change Directory

To change to a different directory, use the `cd` command:

```bash
cd directory_name
```

### Create a Directory

To create a new directory, use the `mkdir` command:

```bash
mkdir new_directory
```

### Remove a File or Directory

To remove a file, use the `rm` command:

```bash
rm file_name
```

To remove a directory and its contents, use:

```bash
rm -r directory_name
```

### Create a New File

To create a new file, use the `touch` command:

```bash
touch new_file.txt
```

## Navigating Through Directories

### Navigate to Home Directory

To navigate to the home directory, use:

```bash
cd ~
```

### Navigate to the Parent Directory

To navigate to the parent directory, use:

```bash
cd ..
```

### Move a File to a Different Location

To move a file to a different location, use the `mv` command:

```bash
mv file_name /path/to/destination/
```

### Copy a File

To copy a file, use the `cp` command:

```bash
cp file_name /path/to/destination/
```

## User and Group Management

### Create a New User

To create a new user, use the `useradd` command:

```bash
sudo useradd new_user
```

### Create a New Group

To create a new group, use the `groupadd` command:

```bash
sudo groupadd new_group
```

### Add User to a Group

To add a user to a group, use the `usermod` command:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG new_group new_user
```

### Delete a User

To delete a user, use the `userdel` command:

```bash
sudo userdel new_user
```

### Delete a Group
